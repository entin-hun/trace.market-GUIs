# Introduction

Details of processes, products and contributions are often stored in siloes, therefore not available for stakeholders when they would need it, while waste and ineffective resources reducing sustainability.

## The challenges we solve

* **Counterfeit Prevention and Product Safety**: Counterfeiting and false product information are significant issues in global supply chains, leading to financial losses, safety hazards, and reputational damage. Our system will provide verified ownership and quality assurance, reducing risks and ensuring consumer safety.
* **Transparency in Provenance and ESG Reporting**: Consumers and regulators increasingly demand transparency regarding product origins and environmental impact. Our solution will allow companies to accurately track and report the provenance of products and the authenticity of environmental and social impact claims, thereby fostering trust and compliance.
* **Resource Optimization and Responsibility Attribution**: By providing clear visibility into the supply chain and ensuring responsible sourcing, our system will help companies optimize their use of resources, reduce waste, and identify the responsible parties for any discrepancies or issues that arise.

## Our solution

We foster a new paradigm in value chains:

* one where data is not just available, but actionable;
* where waste is not just minimized, but transformed into value;
* and where contributions are not just recognized, but rewarded fairly and transparently.

Therefore, we designed an universal traceability standard, store it on on an unbiased, future-proof common database (on permissionless blockchains), estimate its ecological footprint, and represent each subject as ownable NFTs to eliminate cheating with quantities.

* Single Source of Truth: Storing semantic statements securely on p2p hash storage allows it to be referenced as a single source of truth. Stakeholders can build a comprehensive and interoperable knowledge graph.
* NFT Metadata for Quality Attributes: Complex and detailed quality attributes of Real-World Assets can be made available and challengeable as NFT metadata.
* New Paradigm for Stakeholders: Apps leveraging this system can provide enhanced transparency, traceability, and trust, benefiting all stakeholders involved.

In short, our protocol records immutably how things evolve infinitely, by contributions such as:

* materials (products)
* time (services)
* knowledge (licenses)

## Our system is most ideal for:

* businesses (producers, resellers) dealing with **quality-made** products and **sustainable** practices (anti greenwashing and counterfeiting, expounded pricing), especially in most impactful verticals like:
  * food and agri
  * minerals {batteries, electronics, jewellery}
  * textile
  * construction and electricity
* "get % from revenue" feature:
  * upstream producers (Fair-Trade)
  * inventors and developers
  * providers with spare machine / HR capacity or excess inventory (soon expiring products)

## Benefits

Using our tools can not only verify, but also increase your sustainability:

1. **Economic Impact**: The system will reduce losses from counterfeiting and false information, increase efficiency in resource use, and open up new revenue streams through dynamic pricing and better utilization of spare capacities. This will lead to increased profitability for companies using the system.
2. **Environmental Impact**: By enabling accurate tracking and reporting of environmental impacts, the system will promote more sustainable practices across supply chains. It will encourage companies to reduce their carbon footprint and improve resource efficiency, contributing to global sustainability goals.
3. **Societal Impact**: The enhanced transparency and accountability will improve consumer trust, ensuring that people have access to safe, high-quality products with verified origins. The system will also support fair trade practices and ethical sourcing, benefiting communities involved in the production process.
