# Introduction

Details of processes, products and contributions are often stored in siloes, therefore not available for stakeholders when they would need it, while waste and ineffective resources reducing sustainability.

We foster a new paradigm in value chains:
* one where data is not just available, but actionable;
* where waste is not just minimized, but transformed into value;
* and where contributions are not just recognized, but rewarded fairly and transparently.

Therefore, we designed an universal traceability standard, store it on on an unbiased, future-proof common database (on permissionless blockchains), estimate its ecological footprint, and represent each subject as ownable NFTs to eliminate cheating with quantities.
* Single Source of Truth: Storing semantic statements securely on Swarm allows it to be referenced as a single source of truth. Stakeholders can build a comprehensive and interoperable knowledge graph.
* NFT Metadata for Quality Attributes: Complex and detailed quality attributes of Real-World Assets can be made available and challengeable as NFT metadata.
* New Paradigm for Stakeholders: Apps leveraging this system can provide enhanced transparency, traceability, and trust, benefiting all stakeholders involved.

Our system is most ideal for:
* businesses (producers, resellers) dealing with quality-made products and sustainable practices (anti greenwashing and counterfeiting, expounded pricing)
* "get % from revenue" feature: upstream producers (Fair-Trade), inventors and developers, providers with spare machine or HR capacity or excess inventory (soon expiring products)

Our protocol records immutably how things evolve infinitely, by contributions such as:

* materials (products)
* time (services)
* knowledge (licenses)
