# Marketplace (buy & sell)

## Publish as Listing

When the product's or service slot's details are available in a supported schema, you can mark them as publicly buyable on our List page. After you sign the message, an NFT is minted which can be bought by anyone for the set price, which you'll receive to your connected wallet.

Soon, you'll able to define self-enforcing usage and resell rights.

## Buy on a verified way

Go to our Use page, select the right listing (ensure you have required funds) and Sign the NFT purchase transaction.

## Sell to user outside the system

As the current owner of the NFT, you are free to send it to any address from your web3 wallet, like MetaMask.
